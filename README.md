A prototype smartphone application demonstrating colocation capabilities in augmented reality using Unity AR Foundation and Photon Networking. I developed this during 2020 COVID-19 quarantine. Users scan their local environment and then log into a virtual space with other users. All users present in the virtual space are represented by a 3D avatar; in this case, I used a static model of R2-D2. Photon captures their physical movement and updates their AR avatar positions so that users can move around the virtual area and interact with other users in augmented reality.
