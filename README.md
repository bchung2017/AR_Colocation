A prototype application demonstrating colocation capabilities in smartphone-based augmented reality using Unity AR Foundation and Photon Networking. Users first scan their local environment and then log into a virtual space with other users. Photon captures their physical movement and updates their AR avatar position, so that users can move around the virtual area and interact with other users in augmented reality.
